This is will be my first computer-vision project.

# Abstract
This project presents a real-time attendance system based on computer vision and facial recognition technology. The goal is to replace manual or card-based attendance methods with a more accurate, contactless, and automated solution. Using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library, the system captures real-time video from a webcam, detects student faces using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method. Detected faces are aligned using facial landmark estimation. For face encoding, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with the triplet loss method generates a 128-dimensional embedding that uniquely represents each face and matches them against a database of known encodings, and records attendance with timestamps. Names and attendance times are stored in a CSV file for easy record-keeping. The system improves efficiency, minimizes errors, and demonstrates how modern computer vision techniques can streamline administrative processes in a school setting. This software-based approach is cost-effective and scalable, making it a practical solution for classroom attendance management.
